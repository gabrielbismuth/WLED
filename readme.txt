README - W-LED Control PCB

Overview

This PCB is designed for controlling W-LEDs with a dedicated GPIO control on pin 25. It features reverse polarity protection to prevent damage from incorrect power connections, ensuring safe and reliable operation.

Important Notice: Voltage Input Connection

When connecting the power input, be mindful of the terminal placement:

The PCB features a screw terminal for power input.

The polarity of the voltage applied on one terminal will be reflected on the corresponding side of the output terminal.

If you connect the positive voltage to the left terminal, the output terminal will also have the positive voltage on the left side.

If you connect the positive voltage to the right terminal, the output terminal will have the positive voltage on the right side.

Recommendation
Double-check your connections before powering the board.
Ensure correct polarity to avoid incorrect wiring in your setup.
